To make use of extensions, including adding Desktop support,
you need first to install ghc-xmonad-contrib-devel.

= EWMH Desktop support =
xmonad does not work well with desktop environment panels out of the box.
See:
- /usr/share/doc/ghc/html/libraries/xmonad-contrib-$version/XMonad-Config-Desktop.html
- http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Basic_Desktop_Environment_Integration
for how to setup desktop support.

== GNOME ==
Then you can override xmonad as your GNOME default window manager with:

$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session session-name xmonad

= Bluetile =
New users may find the Bluetile window manager built
on top of xmonad-contrib a gentler introduction to xmonad
