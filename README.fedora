= Packaging =
xmonad in Fedora is provided by 3 subpackages:

- xmonad-basic: just the base window manager and X session files
- xmonad: additionally installs the devel library files needed to configure and customize xmonad
- xmonad-gnome: additionally includes a gnome session file and requires gnome-session and gnome-terminal

= Starting from GDM =
xmonad can be started from GDM by selecting "xmonad" in the session menu.

For GNOME support please install xmonad-gnome
and select "xmonad GNOME" in GDM's session menu, which will run
"gnome-session --session=xmonad".

= Gnome Panel =
To activate the gnome-panel menu use Alt+Super+Button3 or Alt+Button3.

= xmonad-start =
For new users without "~/.xmonad/", Fedora's xmonad-start script
displays "man xmonad" in a terminal to provide help initially.

To stop this behaviour, just create "~/.xmonad/".

With the xmonad, xmonad-config, or xmonad packages installed,
xmonad-start will create a basic "~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs" file
configured for desktops.

= Configuration references =
- xmonad man-page
- /usr/share/doc/xmonad-$version/xmonad.hs (default upstream configuration)
- /usr/share/doc/ghc/html/libraries/xmonad-contrib-$version/index.html
and online:
- XMonad wiki: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad
- http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/xmonad-contrib/latest/doc/html/XMonad-Doc.html
  (detailed configuration information and examples)
- http://xmonad.org/ website

= Bluetile =
New users may find the Bluetile window manager built on top of
xmonad-contrib a gentler introduction to xmonad and tiling.
